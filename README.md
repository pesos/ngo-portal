Seva Project
============

The goal is to create a website for the iCare group to help out NGOs and volunteering students. This is a very basic site forked from Pinax (which is based on Django). 

Completed:
-----------
- Student registration form (forms.py)

Todo:
-----
Please check the spec_sheet.docx for more information. It is still very vague, improving it with specific details would be the goal. If possible, convert it to plaintext (markdown?).
There are few wireframes in the wireframes/ folder.
- Check out the issues

How to contribute:
------------------
You can probably check out the django docs at https://www.djangoproject.com/. This is an MVC (Model view controller) framework.
For an example, check out forms.py that is used in views.py. Finally, configured in urls.py


Setup:
-----
  pip install -r requirements.txt

After your edits
  ./start.sh
This is tiny bash script to syncdb and runserver

Please checkout the references for specifics:
---------------------------------------------
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/

Check out the requirements.txt

Googling should take you to their corresponding documentation like

http://django-user-accounts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html



Pretty much everything is a Google away. If you are stuck feel free to mail me.
